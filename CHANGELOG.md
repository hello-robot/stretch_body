# Changelog

The changes between releases of Stretch Body are documented here.

## [0.6.8](https://pypi.org/project/hello-robot-stretch-body/0.6.8/) - December 7, 2023
- Deprecate `robot.is_calibrated()` and introduce `robot.is_homed()` to match homing nomenclature used elsewhere ([details](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/212))
- Added a `robot.wait_command()` method to easily block process execution until motion is completed ([details](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/211))
- Added Dex Wrist URDF visualization to the `stretch_robot_urdf_visualizer.py` tool
- Automatic checking for updates in background while homing + user notification about out-of-date software in `stretch_robot_system_check.py` ([details](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/213))
- Add mutex locking on Stretch Body + introduce `stretch_free_robot_process.py` tool ([details](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/218))

## [0.6.2](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/203) - September 11, 2023
- Introduces the new set of Gamepad modules to teleop stretch using the provided physical gamepad or any other UI input devices. This gamepad controller primarily uses velocity control.
- The stretch_gamepad_teleop.py tool is added and we are deprecating the old position control based stretch_xbox_teleop_controller.py
- The new controller now has a precision mode, allowing users to make fine-grain robot motions.

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/206) - October 7, 2023
This is the initial productioon release that supports Prince batch.
- Introduces the P4 firmware protocol support
- Adds Prince batch params and new pimu IMU support  
## [0.5.0](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/188) - July 11, 2023
- Introduces the **use_asyncio**  mode that will enable using asynchronous IO call methods to perform robot push/pull commands and RPC transactions with the help of [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) to speed up the USB device communications. This mode can be toggled back to use the regular non-async IO calls by changing the stretch params `use_asyncio`.
- By default, the asyncio mode is enabled.
- Adds the P3 protocol support for all the Arduino devices (stepper, pimu, wacc).
- Also, for the asynchronous [transport layer](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/transport.py#L790) to work, the devices firmware will need to support V1 transport protocol that is supported with firmware only above [v0.5.0p3]() for all hello-* arduino devices. For older firmwares, the `async_io` would be disabled automatically
- The  DXLStatusThread of robot class is now separated into two threads: [DXLHeadStatusThread](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/feature/transport_v1_asyncio/body/stretch_body/robot.py#L24) and [DXLEndofArmStatusThread](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/feature/transport_v1_asyncio/body/stretch_body/robot.py#L51) (Both threads run at 15Hz).
- Now the robot monitor, trace, sentry, and collision manager handles stepping is moved out of the NonDXLStatusThread. Instead, it is moved to a new separate thread called [SystemMonitorThread](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/feature/transport_v1_asyncio/body/stretch_body/robot.py#L140) is used to [step these handles](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/feature/transport_v1_asyncio/body/stretch_body/robot.py#L140), which also runs at 25Hz.
- The Robot class can be [`startup()`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/robot.py#L212) with the optional parameters to turn off some threads to save system resources.
- Added status_aux pull status RPCs feature for all the devices. [`motor_sync_cnt`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/pimu.py#L319) and [`motor_sync_queues`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/pimu.py#L317) status messages are populated with AUX pull status
- Now the RPC transactions queues is deprecated, instead [`do_pull_transaction_vX()`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/transport.py#L272) and [`do_push_transaction_vX()`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/transport.py#L189) methods are used from the [SyncTransactionHandler](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/transport.py#L75).
- Asynchournous RPC transactions are handled by [AsyncTransactionHandler](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/transport.py#L458) that create analougus async methods to the one present in [SyncTransactionHandler](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/master/body/stretch_body/transport.py#L75).



## [0.4.8](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/148) - Sept 14, 2022

This is the initial production release that supports the Stretch RE2 (Mitski batch).

* This includes the [`robot_params_RE2V0.py`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/79be4b6441a1c451436aa65c23b1920282e3fed7/body/stretch_body/robot_params_RE2V0.py) which are the initial robot settings for the RE2 version of the product.

* It introduces the [PrismaticJoint](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/79be4b6441a1c451436aa65c23b1920282e3fed7/body/stretch_body/prismatic_joint.py#L10) class which consolidates the common Arm and Lift functionality.

* It changes the units for guarded contact motion from approximate Newtons (suffix _N) to `effort_pct` - the pecentage [-100,100] of maximum current (A) that a joint should stop at. This change requires RE1 users to migrate their code and robot parameters. [See the forum post](https://forum.hello-robot.com/t/stretch-body-release-0-4-and-new-contact-model-units/476/1) for more details.

* It introduces [`mkdocs.yaml`](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/blob/79be4b6441a1c451436aa65c23b1920282e3fed7/mkdocs.yml) to support serving the repository documenation via MKDocs.

It introduces several new features and fixes several bugs, notably:

* [Adds `wait_until_at_setpoint()` to the Arm and Lift classes](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/commit/d15e3fb4416a5b296a184148df7b2045cf16027d)
* [Adds use of argparse with all tools](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/commit/c9c79d6fa08d0aec7d217e2e1d9a9d36b15145b1)
* [Moves Robot thread rates to YAML](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/commit/0fa82e852f98031064a4dbfba722af6da43bc992)
* [Cleans up the splined trajectory interface, enables velocity controlled splined trajectories for the Dynamixels](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/commit/13549e3662a3168c2a6f460f52c6577d0dbf5b5d)
* [Flags a warning for users incorrectly setting the homing offset on DXL servos](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/151)



## [0.3.4](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/142) - July 20, 2022

Release to add minor features and fix minor bugs:

* Add a `range_pad_t` parameter to allow for padding of hardstops for joint homing
* [Clean up tools and warnings to more consistent and legible #140](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/140)


## [0.3.0](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/129) - June 21, 2022
This release moves Stretch Body to use a new parameter management format. This change will require older systems to migrate their parameters to the new format. For systems that haven't yet migrated, Stretch Body will exit with a warning that they must migrate first by running `RE1_migrate_params.py`. See the [forum post](https://forum.hello-robot.com/t/425) for more details.

Features:

 - [New param management and RE1.5 support #135](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/135)

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/129) - January 6, 2022
Release to fix two bugs:

 - [Fix goto commands in the head jog tool #128](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/128) - Fixes goto commands in the head jog tool
 - [Fix port_handler location #121](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/121) - Fixes dxl buffer resetting under a serial communication failure

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/118) - December 28, 2021
This release brings support for waypoint trajectories into master. Support for waypoint trajectories was built up over the last year in the [feature/waypoint_trajectories_py3](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/tree/feature/waypoint_trajectories_py3) branch, however, this branch couldn't be merged because the new functionality had flaky performance due to subtle bugs. This branch also attempted to introduce support for Python3 and timestamp synchronization. Support for Python3 and other features were merged in [v0.1.0](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/35). The remaining features from this branch have been broken into 7 PRs, each targeting a specific device and squashing any previous bugs through functional and performance testing. They are:

 - [Introduce waypoint trajectory RPCs #98](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/98)
 - [Add individual device threading #105](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/105)
 - [Trajectory management classes #106](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/106)
 - [Lift and arm trajectories #110](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/110)
 - [Dynamixel trajectories #113](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/113)
 - [Mobile base trajectories #114](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/114)
 - [Whole body trajectories #115](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/115)

This release also fixes several bugs. They are:

 - [fixed baud map bug #117](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/117)
 - [fix contact thresh bug #116](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_body/pull/116)

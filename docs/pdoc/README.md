# Overview
Pdoc auto-generates API documentation that follows your project's Python module hierarchy. To download pdoc input the next command in your terminal.
```{.bash .shell-prompt}
pip install pdoc
```

## Instructions
To generate the API documentation you need to follow this steps. First in your terminal type.
```{.bash .shell-prompt}
cd repos/stretch_body/docs/pdoc
```
Now that you are in the correct path you can start generating the documentation for Stretch Body, again in the terminal type.
```{.bash .shell-prompt}
firefox index.html
```
With this a tab in your firefox browser will open and it will be the documentation of the Stretch Body!

If you want to change something in the docs you can do that, open the file that you want to change, make the changes and save, then you can type in the same terminal.
```{.bash .shell-prompt}
./make.sh
```
Now refresh the page in your browser and you will see the changes there.
